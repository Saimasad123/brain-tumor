# brain-tumor
This project implements a comprehensive brain tumor detection system developed in both MATLAB and Python using OpenCV. The system uses watershed segmentation and morphological operations to detect brain tumors in MRI images, with implementations in both environments for maximum flexibility and accessibility.
